FUCK THE BOLTER!!!: While other chapter’s marines will spend decades honing their skills with the bolter with stationary drills,
indoctrination, strip cleaning, combat drills etc, the angry marines... don’t. They see the bolter as a means of keeping the enemies 
heads down and a crude club at best, and a “WASTE OF FUCKING SPACE AND WEIGHT WHICH I COULD USE TO CARRY A FUCKING TWO BY FOUR!!!” 
As such, Angry Marines are nowhere near as well drilled in using the bolter as their cousin chapters. Or at least, not as well drilled in the bolters conventional uses...
